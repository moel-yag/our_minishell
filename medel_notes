// This is the expected output when running the command `env | grep n` in a shell that has an `env` command that does not accept arguments.
// The error message indicates that the `env` command was called with too many arguments,
// which is consistent with the behavior of the `ft_env` function in the provided code snippet.

// However, the shell typically only allows one output redirection per command.
